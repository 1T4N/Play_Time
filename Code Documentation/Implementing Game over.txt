1. add the game over component to the game. the component is located in letter tracing component folder

2. in the root scene > ready function, add the following code:
	func _ready() -> void:
		#this resets the data
		globalGameData.resetData()
		#change the number base on the game
		globalGameData.currentGameID = 0

3. locate in the code where/when should the game over popup would appear

4. add the following code in that script:
	#region gameOverPopUP - fylart
	@onready var game_over_component: PanelContainer = $GameOverComponent
	func showGameOver():
		get_tree().paused = true
		game_over_component.show()
		var childrens = game_over_component.get_children()
		for child in childrens:
			if child.is_in_group("persist"):
				child.save()
	#you need to call this function after adding it 

	#if there's a timer to game over, connect that in this function
	func onTimeEnd():
		showGameOver()
	#endregion

5. find where the score is being incremented/added. add this code there:
	globalGameData.currentGameScore = score

6. head over to the saving component > data saving component > script > match case 

7. add the number of the game (the first step in game id) and then write the name of the data
